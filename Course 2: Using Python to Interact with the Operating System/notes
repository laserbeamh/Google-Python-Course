Creating python modules:
it seems to literally just be a separate python file
e.g.:
cat areas.py
import math

def triangle(base, height):
	return base*height/2

def rectangle(base, height):
	return base*height
	
def circle(radius):
	return math.pi*(radius**2)

cat other_file
import areas

if the module is large, create a directory with the name of the module with separate .py submodules
	will need an __init__.py module
	
pitfalls of automation
	have to write the script

typically want to script out complex tasks so errors aren't made

Pareto Principle: 20% of the sysadmin tasks you perform are responsible for 80% of your work

bit-rot = process of software falling out of step with the env

don't have false confidence in automation
build in notification for automation errors
build in errors for the log

test automation periodically

check the health of the computer
shutil module (disk usage)
psutil module (CPU usage)
